# Project - Diversity Networks with DPPs
This project is a term project of the course Big Data and Machine Learning in Spring 2019, taught by Prof. Krzysztof Choromanski at Columbia University.

## Problem
Consider compression mechanism for neural network models proposed in the paper below. In that paper the kernel for L-ensembles process defining DPP used to subsample neurons is fixed (Gaussian kernel). Experiment with different methods of choosing/learning this kernel (you can even try to learn it by applying ES algorithms) and present your experimental results by comparing the quality of the obtained compressed neural networks. Can you beat DIVNETs from that paper?
